# Where do I start?

(This doc is a work in progress).

If you're a software engineer looking to learn about the field of resilience
engineering, the sheer number of papers can be intimidating. 

The material can also be confusing because resilience engineering evolved from the
safety systems community (domains such as aviation, medicine, maritime, space flight, nuclear power,
military, rail), which means that some papers are reactions to earlier approaches to
achieving safety, which is context the reader is likely to be missing.

I myself am still a novice in this area, so take this guidance with an
appropriate grain of salt.

## Themes

Some general themes are:

* changing perspective on accidents and safety
* automation
* coordination
* adaptation
* coping
* learning

These themes overlap, and so a paper may touch on multiple themes. For eample, automation and coordination
overlap in papers that deal with "automation as a team player".



## If you read only one paper

Richard I. Cook's [How complex systems fail](http://web.mit.edu/2.75/resources/random/How%20Complex%20Systems%20Fail.pdf) is a great
starting point. It's short and very easy to read.

## Classics

These are older papers that are often referenced:

* Bainbridge's [Ironies of automation](https://doi.org/10.1016/0005-1098(83)90046-8) (1983)
* Rasmussen's [Risk management in a dynamic society: a modelling problem](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0925-7535(97)00052-0) (1997) (paywalled)

Bainbridge's paper on automation is as relevant today as when it was written
almost 40 years ago.

Rasmussen's body of work is extremely influential in the resilience engineering
community.  In this widely cited paper, Rasmussen advocates for a cross-disciplinary,
systems-based approach to thinking about how accidents occur. He argues that
accidents occur because the system migrates across a dangerous boundary, and
this migration occurs during the course of normal work.

## Changing perspective on accidents and safety

Over the past few decades, there has been a change in the safety science community about how to understand
accidents in particular, and safety in general. You may hear terms such as "new look", "new view", or "Safety-II".

## Automation

[Ironies of automation](https://doi.org/10.1016/0005-1098(83)90046-8) is discussed in the [classics](#classics) section.



* [Ten challenges for making automation a team player]
* [Cognitive consequences of clumsy automation on high workload, high consequence human performance]
* [Implications of automation surprises in aviation for the future of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA)]

## Coordination

[Common Ground and Coordination in Joint Activity] is an often-cited paper on how people coordinate to perform
tasks together.

## Adaptation

## Coping


[Being bumpable](http://csel.eng.ohio-state.edu/productions/woodscta/media/beingbump.pdf) looks at how medical professionals cope with increasing load in environments such as an intensive care unit.

## Learning
