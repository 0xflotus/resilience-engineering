# Where do I start?

(This doc is still in progress).

If you're a software engineer looking to learn about the field of resilience
engineering, the sheer number of papers can be intimidating. 

The material can also be confusing because resilience engineering evolved from the
safety systems community (domains such as aviation, medicine, maritime, space flight, nuclear power,
military, rail), which means that some papers are reactions to earlier approaches to
achieving safety, which is context the reader is likely to be missing.

I myself am still a novice in this area, so take this guidance with an
appropriate grain of salt.


## If you read only one paper

Richard I. Cook's [How complex systems fail](http://web.mit.edu/2.75/resources/random/How%20Complex%20Systems%20Fail.pdf) is a great
starting point. It's short and very easy to read.

## Overview of new view / Safety-II

Resilience engineering is synonymous with a new perspective on the role of
human behavior in accidents. You'll hear terms such as the "new view" (as
opposed to the old view) or "Safety-II" (as opposed to "Safety-I").

Two readable papers that contrast the new perspective with the old one are:

* Dekker's [Reconstructing human contributions to accidents: the new view on error and performance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437502000324) (paywalled)
* Hollnagel's [From Safety-I to Safety-II: A White Paper](https://www.skybrary.aero/bookshelf/books/2437.pdf)

## Classics

These are older papers that are often referenced:

* Bainbridge's [Ironies of automation](https://doi.org/10.1016/0005-1098(83)90046-8) (1983)
* Rasmussen's [Risk management in a dynamic society: a modelling problem](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0925-7535(97)00052-0) (1997) (paywalled)

Bainbridge's paper on automation is as relevant today as when it was written
almost 40 years ago.

Rasmussen's body of work is extremely influential in the resilience engineering
community.  In this widely cited paper, Rasmussen advocates for a cross-disciplinary,
systems-based approach to thinking about how accidents occur. He argues that
accidents occur because the system migrates across a dangerous boundary, and
this migration occurs during the course of normal work.
