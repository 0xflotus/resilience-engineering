# Where do I start?

The sheer number of resilience engineering papers can be intimidating. Here's
some guidance on where to start reading if you're new to the field.

## If you read only one paper

Richard I. Cook's [How complex systems fail](http://web.mit.edu/2.75/resources/random/How%20Complex%20Systems%20Fail.pdf) is a great
starting point. It's short and very easy to read.

## Overview of new view / Safety-II

Resilience engineering is synonymous with a new perspective on the role of
human behavior in accidents. This is sometimes called the "new view" (as
opposed to the old view) or "Safety-II" (as opposed to "Safety-I").

Two readable papers that contrast the new perspective with the old one are:

* Dekker's [Reconstructing human contributions to accidents: the new view on error and performance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437502000324) (paywalled)
* Hollnagel's [From Safety-I to Safety-II: A White Paper](https://www.skybrary.aero/bookshelf/books/2437.pdf)

## Classics

These are older papers that are often referenced:

* Bainbridge's [Ironies of automation](https://doi.org/10.1016/0005-1098(83)90046-8) (1983)
* Rasmussen's [Risk management in a dynamic society: a modelling problem](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0925-7535(97)00052-0) (1997) (paywalled)

Bainbridge's paper on automation is as relevant today as when it was written
almost 40 years ago.

Rasmussen's body of work is extremely influential in the resilience engineering
community.  In this widely cited paper, Rasmussen advocates for a cross-disciplinary,
systems-based approach to thinking about how accidents occur. He argues that
accidents occur because the system migrates across a dangerous boundary, and
this migration occurs during the course of normal work.
