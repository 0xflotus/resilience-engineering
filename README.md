# Resilience Engineering notes

This file contains notes about the field of resilience engineering, organized
by researcher/author. I'm using these notes to help me get my head around the
different players and associated concepts.

For each author, I list concepts that I associate with that researcher (i.e.,
that they reference in their writings), and some selected publications that
they've written. The publications listed aren't comprehensive: they're either
ones I've read or ones that are currently on my to-read list. 

Authors are listed here in alphabetical order.
