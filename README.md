# Resilience Engineering notes

This file contains notes about the field of resilience engineering, organized
by researcher/author. I'm using these notes to help me get my head around the
different players and associated concepts.

For each author, I list concepts that I associate with that researcher (i.e.,
that they reference in their writings), and some selected publications that
they've written. The publications listed aren't comprehensive: they're either
ones I've read or ones that are currently on my to-read list. 

Authors are listed here in alphabetical order.

## Anders Ericsson

Ericsson introduced the idea of *deliberative practice* as a mechanism for
achieving high level of expertise.

Ericsson isn't directly associated with the field of resilience engineering.

interest in how people improve in expertise, so I'm including him here.
