# Laws, tradeoffs and theorems

## Law of fluency

Well-adapted cognitive work occurs with a facility that belies the difficulty
of resolving demands and balancing dilemmas

## Law of stretched systems

Every system is stretched to operate at its capacity.

## Law of requisite variety

The larger the variety of actions available to a control system, the larger the
variety of perturbations it is able to compensate.

## Laws of the adaptive universe

* Resources are finite
* Surprise is fundamental
* Change never stops

## Efficiency-thoroughness tradeoff

People (and organisations) as part of their activities frequently – or always –
have to make a trade-off between the resources (primarily time and effort) they
spend on preparing to do something and the resources (primarily time and
effort) they spend on doing it.

## Optimality-brittleness tradeoff

The pursuit of increases in optimality with respect to some criteria 
guarantees an increase in brittleness with respect to changes or variations
that fall outside of those criteria.

##  Thereoms of graceful extensibility

* *UAB* stands for unit of adaptive behavior
* *CfM* stands for capacity for maneuver


1. Adaptive capacity is finite
2. Events will produce demands that challenge boundaries on the adaptive
   capacity of any UAB
3. Adaptive capacities are regulated to manage the risk of saturating CfM
4. No UAB can have sufficient ability to regulate CfM to manage the risk of saturation alone
5. Some UABs monitor and regulate the CfM of other UABs in response to changes
   in the risk of saturation
6. Adaptive capacity is the potential for adjusting patterns of action to
   handle future situations, events, opportunities and disruptions
7. Performance of a UAB as it approaches saturation is different from the
   perforamnce of that UAB when it operates far from saturation
8. All UABs are local
9. There are bounds on the perspective any UAB, but these limits are overcome
   by shifts and contrasts over multiple perspectives.
10. Reflective systems risk mis-calbiration


## Law of coordinative entropy

Coordination costs, continuously.

## Law of systems as surrogates

Technology reflects the stances, agendas, and goals of those who design and deploy the technology.

## Mr. Weasley's Law

Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain.

## The Law of the Kludge

Work systems always require workarounds, with resultant kludges that attempt
to bridge the gap between the original design objectives and current realities
or to reconcile conflicting goals among workers.
